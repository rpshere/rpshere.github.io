<h1>Hey Niharika ❤️</h1>

<p>
  I just wanted to be honest and share something I’ve been feeling.
  I really enjoy talking to you and being around you, and over time,
  those feelings have quietly grown into something more.
  <br><br>
  If you feel the same way, I’d love to see where this could go,
  at a pace that feels comfortable for you.
  And if you don’t, that’s completely okay too —
  please take this as a genuine compliment, nothing more.
  <br><br>
  I just felt it was worth sharing.
</p>

<h1>Will you be my Valentine? 💖</h1>

<button onclick="alert('No matter what, thank you for being honest ❤️')">
  Yes 💘
</button></head>

  <h1>Hey, my love ❤️</h1>

  <p>
    Every day with you feels special.  
    Your smile, your voice, the way you make everything lighter —
    it all means more to me than I can put into words.  
    <br><br>
    So today, I just want to ask you one simple thing…
  </p>

  <h1>Will you be my Valentine? 💖</h1>

  <button onclick="alert('She said YES 💕')">Yes 💘</button>
